## Overview

In this project, I focused on developing an internal ticketing system to streamline task submissions, 
approvals, and execution within an organization. The main goal was to reduce communication gaps, 
improve accountability, and create a transparent workflow where every request can be tracked from start 
to finish. By implementing role-based access control, structured ticket handling, 
and automated notifications, the system ensures that the right people are always informed 
and responsible at the right stage.


## Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implemented multiple roles including Admin, Coordinator, KD (decision maker), 
PIC (executor), and Users, each with tailored permissions to maintain accountability and security.

- **Ticket Management**:Enabled users to submit tickets with details and attachments, while coordinators and KDs can review, approve, assign, or reject tickets as needed.

- **File Handling**: Supported multiple file uploads, secure storage, and the ability to preview or delete individual attachments while keeping the database in sync.

- **Scalable Design System**: Developed a React + Ant Design interface featuring clean card layouts, vertical file lists, and intuitive ticket timelines for tracking progress.

- **UI & Usability Improvements**: Developed a React + Ant Design interface featuring clean card layouts, vertical file lists, and intuitive ticket timelines for tracking progress.




## Technologies Used

- **Laravel 10**: For backend API, authentication, and file storage handling.
- **React js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **MySQL**: For structured ticket, role, and history data storage.

- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository also version controll  .


One of the main challenges was ensuring proper synchronization between uploaded files, database records, and storage management. This required careful handling of file deletion logic and error states. Another complexity was designing the approval workflow so that it remained strict enough for accountability
